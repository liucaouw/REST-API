# REST-API
Working with data from across the web

### REST (REpresentational State Transfer) API
1. A RESTful API is an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to create, read, update, and delete data using a web protocol
2. REST stands for Representational State Transfer, and is simply a standard way of transmitting data and representing it using HTTP.
3. Many organizations make their data available over REST so that third party apps can interoperate with their data

### Interoperating with Web Data
1. REST API Data is typically transmitted via JSON, and sometimes using XML (though this is now less common).
2. JSON can easily be converted to a Python Dictionary and traversed programmatically
3. JSON dictionaries are also referred to as “trees” — as there are many branches that can be traversed
4. An important programming skill is learning how to traverse a tree to find only the data that you are interested in.

### Why is this useful?
1. For accessing data that is constantly changing (news data, user-generated content)
2. For civic and open data initiatives (ideally to promote transparency, but there are issues)
3. Mashups: Apps and websites are generated from many different data sources. Allows you to show multiple data feeds at once
4. Customization — you can build custom interfaces and experiences
