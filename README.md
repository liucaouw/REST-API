# REST-API
Working with data from across the web

In this project, we can learn four things:
1. Looking at how JSON data dictionaries are organized.
2. Working with API Endpoints and Web Services.
3. Examining libraries that interact with web services.
4. Working with python dictionaries to create outputs beyond the command line, including creating HTML widgets and sending Emails.  
You should get authentication first, paste the API token code in the first line of authentication.py. Then, open the ipynb files and run them to send an email or search for something you need on YouTube or Spotify.

### REST (REpresentational State Transfer) API
1. A RESTful API is an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to create, read, update, and delete data using a web protocol
2. REST stands for Representational State Transfer, and is simply a standard way of transmitting data and representing it using HTTP.
3. Many organizations make their data available over REST so that third party apps can interoperate with their data
Some examples of companies and organizations that have REST APIs include:  
[Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/get_started)  
[Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/)  
[Twitter](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/search/overview)

### Interoperating with Web Data
1. REST API Data is typically transmitted via JSON, and sometimes using XML (though this is now less common).
2. JSON can easily be converted to a Python Dictionary and traversed programmatically
3. JSON dictionaries are also referred to as “trees” — as there are many branches that can be traversed
4. An important programming skill is learning how to traverse a tree to find only the data that you are interested in.

### Why is this useful?
1. For accessing data that is constantly changing (news data, user-generated content)
2. For civic and open data initiatives (ideally to promote transparency, but there are issues)
3. Mashups: Apps and websites are generated from many different data sources. Allows you to show multiple data feeds at once
4. Customization — you can build custom interfaces and experiences
